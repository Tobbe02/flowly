Flowly - tools for interactive analysis
=======================================

Flowly is designed to be used in interactive tasks, in particular data
analysis. It aims to be a low overhead library, that fits well into existing
code. It is built to interact naturally with libraries such as pandas, dask,
and toolz. It offers a number of primitives that can easily be composed to form
complex transformation and analysis pipelines.
